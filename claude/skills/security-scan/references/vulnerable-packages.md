### Patterns to flag (regardless of version):

- `eval` or `vm.runInContext` in dependencies
- Any package pulling in `node-gyp` native addons from unknown publishers
- Packages with < 1000 weekly downloads but required in production code (supply chain risk)

## General Red Flags (Any Ecosystem)

Flag any dependency that:

1. Has not been updated in > 2 years AND has > 10 open security issues
2. Has been deprecated by its maintainer with a security advisory
3. Is a fork of a known package from an unknown publisher (typosquatting)
4. Has a name that's one character off from a popular package (e.g., `lodash` vs `1odash`)
5. Was recently transferred to a new owner (check git history / npm transfer notices)
