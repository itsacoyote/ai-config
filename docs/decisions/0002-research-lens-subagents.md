# 2. Research fans out to parallel lens subagents

Date: 2026-06-30

Status: Accepted

Tracking: beads epic (this feature)

## Context

The `research` skill ran entirely in a single context. Its `allowed-tools` was
`Read` plus a few read-only `Bash` git/grep commands — notably **no `Agent`
tool** — so it could not delegate. One context carried four distinct analysis
jobs at once (reusable code, gaps, patterns/conventions, architectural context)
and leaned on supporting skills (`analyze-code`, `find-patterns`, `web-search`)
invoked inline in the same conversation.

That single-context shape has two costs:

- **Diluted focus.** One pass juggling four questions does each less thoroughly
  than a dedicated pass per question.
- **Context bloat.** All the heavy file-reading happens in the same context that
  must then synthesize and converse, crowding out the synthesis.

The `validate` step already solves the analogous problem by fanning out to
independent agents (`senior-review`, `security-scan`, `design-review`,
`qa-review`) from the main session, then synthesizing. Research had no
equivalent, and there was no lens for **risks/gotchas** — awareness notes a
developer would flag ("this path is security-sensitive", "honor this business
rule", "this bites if missed") — anywhere in the workflow.

## Decision

`research` becomes an **orchestrator + synthesizer**. On every run it fans out to
focused, read-only **lens subagents** in parallel, then weaves their reports into
the conversational findings and the beads epic.

- **Three always-on lenses:**
  - **Reuse & gaps** — what exists to reuse/extend and what is missing (wraps the
    existing `analyze-code` skill).
  - **Patterns & architecture** — how the codebase builds similar things and how
    the layers connect (wraps the existing `find-patterns` skill).
  - **Risks & gotchas** — awareness notes that affect implementation or decisions
    (wraps a **new** `edge-cases-and-risks` skill).
- **Two conditional lenses:**
  - **Outside libraries** — fires only when the feature uses a third-party
    tool/API (wraps the existing `web-search` skill).
  - **Prior art / history** — research **asks the user first** ("check how
    similar features were built before?") and runs it only on a yes; uses git
    history (wraps `git-workflow-and-versioning`'s history guidance). In
    unattended `autorun`, the prompt cannot be answered, so this lens is
    **skipped by default**.
- Each lens is a **thin agent** wrapping a skill, per the repo convention that
  methodology lives in skills.
- The fan-out happens **from the main session (or `autorun`)** — never from a
  subagent, because subagents cannot spawn subagents. `autorun` already composes
  `research` by reading its `SKILL.md` and following it, so it spawns the lens
  agents itself.
- `research`'s `allowed-tools` gains `Agent` so a manual `/research` run can spawn
  the lenses.
- **Output mapping:** each lens fills its section of the findings template. Gaps
  still become beads child issues (unchanged). Risks/gotchas land as an advisory
  **"Risks & Gotchas"** section attached to the epic with the findings — never
  standalone issues, because they are awareness notes, not tracked work.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Each analysis question gets a dedicated, deeper pass; the main context stays
  lean for synthesis and conversation.
- Adds a risks/gotchas lens the workflow never had, persisted on the epic so it
  travels into Plan and Implement.
- Mirrors the proven `validate` fan-out pattern, so the codebase has one
  consistent "step orchestrates independent agents" shape.

**Negative / trade-offs**

- Every Research run now spawns multiple subagents — more tokens and some
  latency, even on small features. The conditional lenses (outside-libraries
  auto-gated, prior-art ask-first) limit the blast radius.
- More files to maintain (one new skill, several thin agents) and overlapping
  file reads across lenses that synthesis must reconcile.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep the single broad "study the code" helper (plus risks).** Rejected: the
  maintainer explicitly wanted a robust split, and one helper juggling four jobs
  is exactly the dilution this change removes.
- **Split patterns and architecture into separate always-on lenses (four core).**
  Considered and offered; the maintainer chose to merge them into one
  "how it's built" lens to keep three core helpers.
- **Make risks/gotchas spawn beads child issues.** Rejected: they are awareness
  notes that are often not actionable on their own; forcing them into tasks
  creates fake work. They live on the epic with the findings instead.
- **Put lens methodology inline in the agent files.** Rejected: breaks the repo
  convention that methodology lives in skills and makes the lenses non-reusable.
