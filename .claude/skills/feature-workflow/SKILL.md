# Feature Workflow

The development workflow: **Define → Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → Document.** This skill is the map — it tells you the sequence and which skill/agent owns each step. Run each step deliberately by hand — or, after Define, hand the rest to `autorun` (see "Running it: by hand or with autorun" below).

This is portable on purpose — it travels with the skills when copied into another project, where the project's own `CLAUDE.md` will not.

## The steps

| # | Step | Skill / agent | Output |
|---|------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | **Define** | `define` skill (+ `documentation-and-adrs`) | An approved spec; ADRs for any significant decisions; the feature branch created |
| 2 | **Research** | `research` skill (+ `analyze-code`, `find-patterns`, `web-search`) | Findings: reusable code, gaps, patterns, constraints |
| 3 | **Plan** | `planning-and-task-breakdown` skill | File map + dependency-ordered tasks with named tests |
| 4 | **Implement** | `incremental-implementation` skill (+ `writing-tests`) | The change, built task by task, tests passing, committed |
| — | *Gate: Plan → Implement* | `plan-review` skill → `plan-review` agent | Plan reviewed before any code; design findings fixed (see below) |
| 5 | **Validate** | `validate` skill → spawns `senior-review` + `design-review` (conditional, frontend) + `qa-review` agents | Reviews passed; findings fixed |
| 6 | **Document** | `document` skill (+ `create-pr`, `documentation-and-adrs`) | Docs updated, PR description written, PR readied |

## How to run it

1. **Define** — `define` walks the spec conversation, creates the branch, and ends at an approval checkpoint. Don't proceed until the spec is approved.
2. **Research** — `research` studies the codebase against the approved spec.
3. **Plan** — `planning-and-task-breakdown` turns spec + research into a file map and ordered tasks.
   - **Gate (Plan → Implement):** before building, run `plan-review` — a staff-engineer design review of the spec + plan (approach, decomposition, interfaces, reuse, risk, spec-alignment, sequencing). It's the pre-build mirror of Validate's reviewers: it catches design flaws while they're a paragraph, not a diff. The skill spawns the `plan-review` agent in a fresh context; fix what it surfaces (a fundamentally wrong approach goes back to Define), then implement. In manual mode it's surfaced for you to act on; under `autorun` it runs automatically (revise-and-re-review, bounded to 3) and only interrupts you if the whole approach is wrong.
4. **Implement** — `incremental-implementation` builds the tasks in order, one increment at a time, with optional mid-implement review checkpoints for risky work.
5. **Validate** — run `validate` from the main session; it spawns the reviewer agents (`senior-review`, `design-review` when the change touches frontend, and `qa-review`) in isolated contexts and loops fixes until they pass.
6. **Document** — `document` audits every doc surface, writes the PR, and readies it.

Each step has a clear entry/exit; advance only when the previous step's output is in hand.

## State and handoff

State flows through **beads** when it's set up, and conversationally when it isn't — every step skill follows the dual-mode contract in [`.claude/references/beads.md`](../../references/beads.md). There is no `.docs/` folder and no `context.yaml`; beads (or the conversation) is the system of record.

## Scope

Skip steps for trivial work — a one-line fix doesn't need the full pipeline. The workflow earns its keep on real features where a missed requirement or a skipped review is expensive. Match the rigor to the change.

## Running it: by hand or with autorun

Run the steps yourself, one at a time — the manual flow above. Or, after Define, hand the rest to **`autorun`**: a supervised orchestrator that runs Research → Document in one pass, implementing each task in a fresh `implementer` subagent, with permissions enforced (you approve actions as they happen) and stopping at a ready-for-review PR. **Two human gates either way — Define and the PR review.**

`autorun` is the in-session, permissions-on automation — *not* an unattended/headless runner; that remains future work. (The archived `/feature` skill automated this differently and is not active.)
